ðŸ”‘ This is just a sample authentication web api made with .NET 5 Framework. The purpose of this web api service is to generate the JWT Token that can be used to make a request to [Weather service](https://github.com/jerichosiahaya/WeatherService). I recommended you to use the [API Gateway](https://github.com/jerichosiahaya/OcelotAPIGateway) as the middleman between both services.
